# 🌪️ Disaster Response AI System

> **Team Name:** Sync Shield 🛡️  
> **Theme:** Disaster Management | AI for Social Good | Smart Cities

An AI-powered disaster response system designed to assist authorities and rescue teams during natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes by providing real-time insights, risk prediction, and optimized rescue operations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Natural disasters cause massive loss of life and infrastructure mainly due to delayed response and lack of accurate real-time information.  
The **Disaster Response AI System** solves this problem by combining **satellite imagery, weather data, and social media signals** to generate actionable intelligence for faster and safer disaster response.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🌊 **Flood Zone Prediction**  
  Uses satellite imagery and weather data to identify high-risk flood areas.

- 🏚️ **Earthquake Damage Detection**  
  Detects damaged buildings and blocked roads using AI-based image analysis.

- 🛣️ **Rescue Route Optimization**  
  Suggests the safest and fastest routes for rescue teams by avoiding flooded or damaged roads.

- 🌡️ **Heatmap Visualization**  
  Displays disaster intensity and risk levels using interactive heatmaps.

- 📢 **Emergency Message Assistant**  
  Automatically generates location-based emergency alerts and safety instructions.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Satellite images are processed using AI models to detect water bodies and damage.
2. Weather APIs provide real-time and forecast data.
3. Social media posts are analyzed to detect on-ground emergency signals.
4. AI fuses all data sources to predict risk zones and optimize rescue routes.
5. Results are visualized on an interactive map and shared via emergency messages.
